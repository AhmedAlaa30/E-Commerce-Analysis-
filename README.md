 I uncovered key KPIs:
Sales revenue, units sold, average. order value per product.
Top-selling products/categories.
Conversion rate.
Customer demographics/behavior analysis.
Despite a data gap in-app user/purchase assignment, here are my recommendations:
Diversify distribution channels.
Tailor marketing to seasons/cultural events.
Offer localized promotions.
Monitor economic indicators for pricing adjustments.
